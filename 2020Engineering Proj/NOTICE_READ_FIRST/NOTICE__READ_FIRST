This code was made for educational purposes; it is to be used as a learning tool and not as a
shortcut to not learn programming. Its intended use is that those learning from it use it
to understand the logic of the code inside, and then apply that knowledge to their own robot.

This code would not be made possible without the expert tutelage of Caden Hewlett and Pedro Amui.
The logic used in this code was taught to me by them, and I am forever grateful.

Abuse this public code, and it will be taken down (made private) immediately.
