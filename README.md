# 1010H-Code-2022
Whether you're from Ten Ton Robotics, another VEX team, or the University of California Admissions Office, welcome to my GitHub page!
My name is Aryan Mosavianpour, the head programmer of team 1010H. This is our code for the VEX 2021/2022 EDR season, written in C++ (using the PROS library). 
The most recent project I've been working on can be found in the "LDRIntegrated" folder. In previous years, I created a robot-autonomization program that records controller input during driver control and plays it back as motor values during autonomous periods. The creation of this involved multiple folders (one for record, one for run, as you can see in this repository), but THIS YEAR, I have successfully used switch-case functions and display code (LVGL) to integrate all of it into one file.
